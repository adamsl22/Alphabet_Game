For more info on my experiments with JS and CSS animations during the development of this game, check out my Medium post at https://medium.com/@adaml22/three-methods-for-animating-movement-in-js-css-579365ec0725.

After cloning, run rails db:migrate and rails db:seed to seed each letter into the database. The game can then be played by opening front-end/index.html and running rails s.
